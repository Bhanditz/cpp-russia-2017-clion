To understand how the types and other declarations are used through the code base, context _Find Usages_ can be helpful:

* Go to GameWidget.cpp, line 27 via typing _GameWidget.cpp:27_ in Go to File pop-up (`⇧⌘O` / `Shift+Ctrl+N`)
* Place a cursor on _bricks_ variable, the usages in the current file will be highlighted automatically 
* To get the full list of all usages, use `⌥F7` / `Alt+F7`
    * Group by file structure
    * Try merging usages from the same line
    * Turn on the preview or autoscroll to source
    * Use `⌥⌘ Up/Down` / `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` to navigate to the next/previous occurence
