# Navigation

## Navigate to something you know
If you already know a file name, symbol or class name you'd like to jump to, use the following:
* Use `⇧⌘O` / `Shift+Ctrl+N` to navigate to the file by its name, go to _GameWidget.cpp_
    * Type less - use CamelHumps: type _GW_
    * Type less - try wild cards: _*.cpp_
    * If you'd like to just to a particular line in a file, try going to a particular line in a file via typing: __GameWidget.cpp:17_
    * If you'd like to jump to a file in a particlar directory, try _3rdparty/cml_ to go to _CMakeLists.txt_ file in a directory
* Use `⌘O` / `Ctrl+N` to navigate to the class by its name: go to _Brick_
* Use `⌥⌘O` / `Shift+Ctrl+Alt+N` to go to a symbol by its name: go to _getCollisionWithBrick_ via typing _gcwb_
