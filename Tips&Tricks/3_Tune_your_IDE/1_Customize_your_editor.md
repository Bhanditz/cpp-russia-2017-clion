# Tune your IDE

## Customize your editor
Let's start from the major question â€“ black or white theme?

* Go to _Settings | Appearance and Behavior | Appearance_, UI Options, select the theme there. Default (white) or Darcula (dark) themes are the options.

Which keymap is your favourite? Which one do you know the best?

* Under _Settings | Keymap_ find plenty of options: Emacs, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, Xcode, etc.

_Note_: this workshop uses Default keymap.

Colors and fonts can be tuned as well to your favourite:

* Select preferred editor scheme and a font of your choice in _Settings | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font_
* Tune color for current editor scheme in _Settings | Editor | Colors & Fonts | C/C++_
    * Here you can select semantic highlighting to understand how the data flow through the code at a glance. Colors are kept unique inside the body of a function or lambda, and identifiers with the same name are assigned the same color.

And finally, if you are lost in the settings, just filter them by typing in the _search_ field.
