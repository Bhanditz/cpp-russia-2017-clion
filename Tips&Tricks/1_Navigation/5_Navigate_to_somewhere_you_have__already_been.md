# Navigation
    
## Navigate to somewhere you've already been
To quickly come back to code locations you've already visited use the following:

* To quickly jump to some recent file, get the list of recently files via `⌘E` / `Ctrl+E`
* To quickly jump to some file edited recently, get the list of recently edited files via `⇧⌘E` / `Shift+Ctrl+E`
* Use bookmarks to mark important places
    * Set a bookmark with `F3` / `F11` (Win/Lin) on the place where the cursor is located
    * View all the bookmarks in either favorites window `⌘2` / `Alt+2` or bookmarks window `⌘F3` / `Shift+F11`
    * Set bookmarks with numbers via `^⇧0` / `Ctrl+Shift+0` (number is from 0 to 9), navigate to it via `^0` / `Ctrl+0` 
* Leave reminders in the code with _TODOs_
    * Use TODO or FIXME
    * Use `⌘6` / `Alt+6` to view all the _TODOs_ in one window, check filters and grouping
    * Note, the IDE can check your _TODOs_ marks before the commit
    * Configure additional templates under _Settings | Editor | TODO_
