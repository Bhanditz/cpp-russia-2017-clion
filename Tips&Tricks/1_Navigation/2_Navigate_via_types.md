# Navigation

## Navigate through the types structure
To understand the code structure better, it's useful to go through the types hierarchies, parent definitions and derived class functions.

* Place a cursor on _Brick_ constructor definition in _Brick.cpp_, use `⌘B` / `Ctrl+B` to navigate to the declaration or use icon in the left-gutter
* Place a cursor on _draw_ function, use `⌘U` / `Ctrl+U` to navigate to the super definition or use icon in the left-gutter
* Use `^⌘↑` / `Ctrl+Alt+Home` to navigate between related symbols (in most cases switch between header/source files)
* Place a cursor on _Brick_ struct declaration in _Brick.h_ and call Go to declaration: `⌘B` / `Ctrl+B` – Find usages pop-up will open
