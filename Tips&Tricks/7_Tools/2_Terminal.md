# Tools

## Terminal
While developing your project in the IDE, you may need to open a simple terminal:
* To install missing software / package / library
* To connect to remote host for remote debug
* To use external tools that are not yet integrated into the IDE
* etc.

For example, if you need to run your program under _valgrind_ to analyse possible memory leaks:
* Press `‚å•F12` / `Alt+F12`
* CLion will open current project folder in the built-in terminal
* Call your program under _valgrind_

Settings, including the start directory and the shell path, are lcoated under _Settings | Tools | Terminal_.
