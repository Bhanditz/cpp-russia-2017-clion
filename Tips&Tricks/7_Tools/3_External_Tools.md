## External Tools
What if you need to run a bash script before/after you build the configuration? For example, you need to configure the environment or copy some build artifacts to another location.

* Open _Settings | Tools | External Tools_
* Add external tool, configure path to the executable, parameters, working directory, etc.
* In _Run | Edit Configurations..._ dialog configure running external tool at a proper stage _or_ use _Tools | External Tools | \<name\>_
