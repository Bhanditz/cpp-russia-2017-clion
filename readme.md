# CLion Workshop

This project is created to help you learn about many of the features and productivity enhancements available in [CLion](https://jetbrains.com/clion). While it doesn't cover EVERY feature in CLion, it does give many, many useful tips and tricks to both beginners and long time users.

Each exercise also introduces the keyboard shortcuts that can be used to work with CLion more efficiently. Should you want to see all the shortcuts in one place, check _Help | Keymap Reference_.
